A simple tool that takes your color input as a hexcode (#000000) and you can lighten and darken it by a slider giving you the respective hexcode of the resultant color.

# Express Code
This code creates a simple Express server and a few additional features dealing with hex codes and background color manipulation. 

## Setup
The code imports Express and Path, defines a port and filename, and establishes a basic Express server. Then, a few functions and event listeners dealing with hex codes, background color manipulation, and RGB conversion are set up and called in the necessary event handlers.
